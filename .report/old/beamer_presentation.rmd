## Outline

- Growth Mixture Modeling

- Common Procedure of GMM

- Misspecification of Time-loading Matrix

- Alternative approaches

- Simulation Study

## Growth Mixture Modeling

### Growth Mixture Modeling
\hfill
- Longitudinal data analysis: dealing with repeated measures on some characteristics over time (ex. trajectories of math ability in children, depressive symptoms across the life course).

- Extension of Latent Growth Curve Modeling (LGM); including latent classes into growth curve modeling

- Latent classes in GMM indicate possible heterogeneity of growth trajectories

- Classifies individuals into different trajectory classes

### Latent Growth Curve Modeling
\hfill

- Estimates an overall trajectory best representing individuals' changes over time.
